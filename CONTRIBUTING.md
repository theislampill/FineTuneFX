5. Commit your changes
6. Push to your fork and open a pull request

## Code Style

- Follow existing patterns in the codebase
- Use `@Observable` and `@MainActor` for state management
- Audio callback code must be real-time safe (no allocations, locks, or ObjC)
- Views: props first, callbacks for mutations, `@State` only for local UI state

## Audio Callback Guidelines

Code running in `processAudio()` must be real-time safe:

- No memory allocations (`malloc`, `new`, `Array.append`)
- No locks (`NSLock`, `DispatchSemaphore`, `os_unfair_lock`)
- No Objective-C messaging
- No file I/O or logging
- No Swift `print()` statements

## Testing

Before submitting:
- Test with 2+ output devices
- Test device hot-plug (disconnect during playback)
- Test with 5+ apps playing audio simultaneously
